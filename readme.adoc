= To-Do List Application

== Overview

This project is a simple command-line To-Do List application written in Java. It allows users to add tasks with descriptions to a to-do list, and also remove tasks from the list.

== Features

* Add tasks to the to-do list with a title and description.
* Remove tasks from the to-do list by specifying the task number.
* Display the current list of tasks.

== Usage

=== Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

=== Running the Application

1. Compile the Java source code:

    javac net/Yass/src/Main/Main.java

2. Run the compiled Java program:

    java net.Yass.src.Main.Main

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the to-do list.

=== Application Flow

1. The application will prompt you if you want to write to-dos.
2. If you respond with "y" or "+", you will be prompted to enter a task title and description.
3. If you choose not to add a task, you will be prompted to enter a task number to delete.
4. The current to-do list will be printed after each addition or deletion of a task.
